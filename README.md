A professional front-end template for building web apps / sites. This is a slimmed down version of [HTML5 boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/). It's mostly the same except for few differences.


## Install
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Tahseenm/html5-boilerplate.git
```

## Compared to H5BP
- Normalise has been replaced with a opinionated reboot.css inspired by [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- No CSS helpers
- Aims to support modern browsers
- No JQuery & moderniser
